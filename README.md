# GifTastic
In this assignment I generated a giphy API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs. 

The topic that interested me was the (6) states of emotion including Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise. Each time the user clicks the buttos it will set a limit to 10 gifs on the page. Each gif has the ability to be paused and played upon a click. Each gif also displays the rating. The user also can type an input into the form that will populate the new gifs.
